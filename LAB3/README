DESCRIPTION:
The primary goal of this lab assignment is to understand various CPU scheduling
algorithms, gain some experience building a simulator for CPU scheduling
algorithm and to evaluate their performances.


************Structure***********
This program holds the main driver in trystan_kaest_lab3.cpp.

The connection to the implementations and class declarations are in
lab3_header.h

The implementations are in lab3_implementation.cpp.

There is an error class held in exceptionStatus.h used to track what went wrong
during read in from a file.

Command line arguments are entered upon run.

makefile in order to compile.
